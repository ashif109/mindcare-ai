Build me a complete, professional, hackathon-winning frontend website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only (no backend for now).

Project Title: MindCare – AI-Powered Student Mental Health Platform

Requirements:
The website should be modern, aesthetic, responsive, fully functional in frontend, with privacy-first approach. It must look like a real working product even though backend is not yet implemented.

Landing Page: Attractive hero section, tagline, call-to-action → “Start Your MindCare Journey”.

👉 Mandatory Features:

Authentication (Frontend Only):

Sign-up & Login pages (form validation, localStorage simulation).

Privacy-first → Show “Your data is encrypted & private” banner.

Profile page → Display user info & saved progress.

AI Stress & Emotion Detection:

Upload/take photo → JS simulates face analysis (happy, sad, stressed, neutral).

Voice input (mic) → Simulated tone/stress detection.

Show results with graphs (Chart.js).

Student Dashboard:

Personalized mental health score.

Quick access to relaxation exercises, daily tips, counselor booking.

Progress Tracker:

Sleep tracker, study hours tracker, mood diary → stored in localStorage.

Display progress in charts/graphs.

AI Copilot Chatbot:

“Quick Help” button always visible in navbar/footer.

Admin Analytics (Simulation):

Graphs: % stressed students, avg. sleep, peak stress hours.

👉 Tech Stack:

Chart.js (analytics/graphs)

Output:

Provide me full working code (HTML, CSS, JS) in a structured format.

All features must look functional in frontend, even if backend is dummy.

Design must be SIH-level modern, sleek, and professional.
